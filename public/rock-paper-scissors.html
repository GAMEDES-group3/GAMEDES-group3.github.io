        >Pick another player to challenge. The two players need to stand in
        front of each other, with their hands up and feet together. Once they
        are in position, they should try to push each other with the hands. Each
        player can try to deceive their opponent by teasing, ducking or fake
        pushing. Players cannot take a step or else they lose.</span
